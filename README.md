Flixproxy
=========

**NOTE: This software is probably no longer sufficient for its original
purpose. However I am keeping the repository around as this might be still
useful for proxying connections to some other service or as a reference.**

Flixproxy implements DNS, HTTP and HTTPS/TLS proxies needed for proxying
Netflix connections:

 - DNS proxy with spoofing capability.

 - HTTP proxy which uses the "Host:" header to determine the backend.

 - TLS (HTTPS) proxy which uses the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
   in the ClientHello TLS packet to determine the backend.

You may be able to use this software to circumvent geoblocking:

1. Setup this proxy in a virtual machine in the desired location. You will
to adjust the configuration to suit your needs.

2. Specify the proxy IP address as the DNS server address in your Smart TV, computer,
router, DHCP or somewhere else.

This software does not work with devices which do not support Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension in their SSL/TLS client implementation.
